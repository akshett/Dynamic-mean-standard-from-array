# Mean and Standard Calculation from an array

This code is used to calculate the mean and standard deviation of elements in an array.

Both are calculated while iterating through the elements in the array so that it is possible to obtain the values in one iteration.

We use the following formula of variance in the calculation:
Var(X) = ∑X² - n∑E[X]
